## Steps to Build the Recommendation System

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Fetch detailed song information using Spotify's Web API. This involves accessing attributes such as track name, artist, duration, and audio features.
   - Example:
     ```python
     sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=os.environ["SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID"],
                                                                client_secret=os.environ["SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET"]))
     ```

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select essential features for recommendation, including danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration, and popularity.
   - These features are crucial for understanding the musical characteristics that drive user preferences and recommendations.

3. **Model Training and Recommendation**:
   - Utilize machine learning techniques, such as cosine similarity, to compare user-selected songs with the dataset and recommend similar tracks.
   - Example:
     ```python
     user_selected_songs = [
         {'name': 'Come As You Are', 'year': 1991},
         {'name': 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'year': 1991},
         {'name': 'Lithium', 'year': 1992}
     ]

     recommended_songs = recommend_songs(user_selected_songs, all_songs_df)
     print("Recommended Songs:")
     for song in recommended_songs:
         print(f"- {song[0]} ({song[1]})")
     ```

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the recommendation system's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - These metrics gauge how accurately the system predicts user preferences and similarity between songs.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the recommendation system as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Django.
   - This step involves integrating the recommendation model into a user-friendly interface accessible via web browsers or mobile apps.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @app.route('/recommend', methods=['POST'])
     def recommend():
         # Recommendation logic here
         return jsonify(recommended_songs)
     ```

   ```

3. **Define functions to fetch song data and calculate recommendations** (full code provided in the repository).

4. **Get song recommendations**:
   ```python
   recommended_songs = recommend_songs([
       {'name': 'Come As You Are', 'year': 1991},
       {'name': 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'year': 1991},
       {'name': 'Lithium', 'year': 1992},
       {'name': 'All Apologies', 'year': 1993},
